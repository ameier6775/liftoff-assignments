Project Outline

Overview

For my project, I plan on creating a hockey application.  My app will show all of the teams in the NHL. It will also have a more in-depth, individual team page which will show more specific details/stats about the team, including a roster of their players. Hopefully, my application will allow each user to save his/her favorite teams and players, which will be an easier way to keep track of these for hockey fans. The idea came from an experience I had last season, having to go through multiple websites(or individual team websites) to check different players statistics, when wanting to see them collectively.

Features

As far as my features go, I had a few mentioned above that I will touch on again.  I want my application to show a list of all the teams in the NHL in individual card components with general team information about each one. Within each team card listed on the teams page, I want to add a button, linking the user to a more detailed page about the team selected. 

Within each team page, I plan to show more specific information about the team selected at the top, and just below, a list of each player on the team, in individual card components. Within every player card on the team page, I want to add a button, linking them to the individual player page where you can see their season statistics and other details.  I also plan to add a login/signup which will allow the user to save their favorite teams as well as their favorite players and add these to their profile home pages.

Technologies

- React JS
- Java Spring Boot
- H2 database
- Material-UI

Learning

In my project, I will learn React, a JS language which I hope will further expand my skillset. Between LC101 and Liftoff, I have been self studying React and hope to use it to help make my site more interactive with the user experience.  H2 is database Iâ€™m not familiar with, is a  so this will help diversify my skillset as well. I plan to show these hockey stats via an NHL API, which I plan to hit via my Java so this will be another learning experience for me.
